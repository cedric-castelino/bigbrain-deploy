Accessibility -

The website utilises colour to provide an accessible experience for users. All elements use contrasting colours, with light blue and white being using as main background colours, with black and grey being used for text elements against these backgrounds. Buttons also utilise colourful backgrounds with white text, to stand out from regular elements, while conforming to the colour contrast requirements. The lowest colour contrast ratio on the website is 4.56:1 (#67677B and #E5EAF0), and is still above the standards set by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for the AA standard.

The website also utilises alt text for all image elements that are displayed. This allows visually impaired individuals to still be informed of the content shown on the page via technologies, such as a screen reader.

The website allows for keyboard navigation on multiple screens including the login page, the register page and the dashboard, three of the main components of the website. Furthermore, the login and register page both have the ability to enter in through the enter key, showcasing easy navigation without the use of a mouse.

The website focuses on focus management, showcasing to see which element is active. This is done through the use of hover, creating a darker or brighter contrast when hovering 
over an element making it more focused visible. furthermore, some elements, such as the modals/forms we have created darken the background, focusing on the form itself. 
There are also some elements that are dynamically changed which include the timer when a player is playing the game.

The website utilises not only px but also relative units such as "vh" and percentages. This makes the website more dynamic allowing users to be able to zoom in and out without
breaking layout.
