Accessibility -

The website utilises colour to provide an accessible experience for users. All elements use contrasting colours, with light blue and white being using as main background colours, with black and grey being used for text elements against these backgrounds. Buttons also utilise colourful backgrounds with white text, to stand out from regular elements, while conforming to the colour contrast requirements. The lowest colour contrast ratio on the website is 4.56:1 (#67677B and #E5EAF0), and is still above the standards set by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for the AA standard.

The website also utilises alt text for all image elements that are displayed. This allows visually impaired individuals to still be informed of the content shown on the page via technologies, such as a screen reader.
