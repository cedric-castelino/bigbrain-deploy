In the Editing Game Data path, we complete the following steps:

    1. Registering a new user
    2. Adding a new game with the title "Quiz" and check that its on the dashboard
    3. Navigate to the edit game page for this new game
    3. Edit the game name and change it to "A better quiz"
    4. Add a new question for the game, filling out every input except the correct answer
        - Encounter an error and check that its shown
        - Fill out the correct answer and create the question without ever leaving the modal
    5. Edit the question duration and title, checking that they have been changed
    6. Remove the question attachment (a YouTube video)
    7. Delete the question and check that there are no more questions in the game
    8. Navigate back to the dashboard
    9. Delete the game and check that there are no more games in the dashboard
    10. Logout and check that the user is on the login page

During this test path, we mainly focus on adding, editing and deleting games and questions. This allows for a range of different modals and forms to be tested, ensuring that errors are encountered, but not disruptive, and that users can intuitively move through the site to access this functionality. After each change, we check to ensure that the correct information is reflected in the on-screen elements. The add questions page is especially a form with several inputs, and we wanted to ensure that the path through this page was smooth, even with hard tasks like uploading a YouTube video link. Overall, this path ensures that our site handles user input in a meaningful, yet simple manner, with all data being error-checked and then uploaded into the database.
